`Workspaces`

- is simply a directory that contains terraform code
- working with terraform invloves managing collections of infrastructure resources and most organizations manage different collections
- when run locally, Terraform manages each collection of infrastructure with a persistent working directory which contains configuration,state data and variables
- since terraform CLI uses content from the directory it runs in, you can organize infrastructure resources into meaningful groups by keeping their configurations in separate directories
- Terraform Cloud manages infrastructure collections with WORKSPACES instead of directories
- A workspace contains everything terraform needs to manage a given collection of infrastructure and separate workspaces function like completely separate working directories
- WORKSPACES are way of creating multiple environments using same code
- separate WORKSPACES function like separate working directories
    - each WORKSPACE has its own terraform.tfstate
    - can run its own version of Terraform
    - can have different set of environment variables
    - terraform.tfstate is stored in directory called terraform.tfstate.d
- Workspaces are not suitable for strong separation isolation
- The default workspace CANNOT be deleted **IMPORTANT**
