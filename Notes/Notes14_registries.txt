`Registries`

- is simply a repository for modules

- Terraform Registry
    - is a repository of modules written by terraform Community
    - instead of writing your own module search registry if someone has written one already
    - VERIFIED MODULES(blue verification badge) in Terraform registry are maintained by various Third Parties like AWS

`Terraform Cloud Public Registry`
- Terraform Registry at registry.terraform.io hosts public modules and providers, but most organizations use modules or providers that cannot or do not need to be publicly available.

`Terraform Cloud Private Registry`
- Terraform cloud includes a private registry that is available to all accounts including free organizations
- unlike public registry, the private registry can import modules from your private VCS repositories on any terraform clouds supported VCS providers.
- also lets you upload and manage private,custom providers through the Terraform cloud API and curate list of commonly-used public providers and modules.
